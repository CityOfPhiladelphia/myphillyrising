<h2>What is PhillyRising?</h2>

<p>City government exists to improve the quality of life for city residents. The goal of the PhillyRising Collaborative is to ensure that all of Philadelphia’s neighborhoods are desirable places to live and work.

<p>Based in the Managing Director’s Office of the City of Philadelphia, PhillyRising brings together City agencies, residents, the Philadelphia Police Department, and outside partners to address chronic crime and quality of life concerns in communities. The PhillyRising team coordinates the actions of these partners to help community members realize their vision for their neighborhoods.

<h2>What makes PhillyRising different?</h2>

<p><strong>Responsive</strong> - Community members know best what their communities need, have, and will accept. The PhillyRising team works with residents to determine realistic ways to improve their community and develop an action plan that is specific to their neighborhood.

<p><strong>Capacity Building</strong> - Through the PhillyRising process, residents learn about resources available in their neighborhoods, empowering them to become leaders in their communities.

<p><strong>Sustainable</strong> - Solutions created through the PhillyRising process are based on residents’ ideas and ultimately run by residents. While City service providers help to coordinate programs, true success comes as residents assume long-term leadership positions.

<p><strong>Cost Effective</strong> - PhillyRising is designed to have minimal financial impact on the public. Instead of adding more funding to neighborhoods, existing resources are coordinated and re-prioritized to maximize efficiency.

<h2>How are neighborhoods chosen?</h2>

<p>The Philadelphia Police Department nominates neighborhoods that face chronic crime and quality of life issues. The Police Department’s Divisional Inspectors and PhillyRising’s Divisional Coordinators evaluate neighborhoods based on crime data and other statistical indicators of quality of life. Neighborhoods that have a correlation between high crime and poor quality of life – areas where crime is facilitated by the nature of the neighborhood environment – are more likely to be chosen as PhillyRising neighborhoods. These areas require a multiagency response and may already have many potential community partners in place.

<h2>What to do if your neighborhood is not listed</h2>

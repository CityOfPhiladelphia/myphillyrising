<p>The PhillyRising Collaborative is the City of Philadelphia’s new way of doing business.

The PhillyRising Team coordinates the actions of City agencies to help neighbors realize their vision for their community through sustainable, responsive, and cost-effective solutions. Together, residents and the City government can keep Philly rising!</p>
